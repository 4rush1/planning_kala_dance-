    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>My client, Usha Bhatnagar, is an Indian Kathak dance teacher in Wellington.
        She wanted me to created website for the students and teachers of her dance
        class, Kala dance. Currently, she communicates with all of her students
        through emails, this is very challenging because there are three dances class,
        and each dance class has a various number of students. All of this becomes
        very challenging for her and she is unable to keep every student ‘in the loop’
        about what is going on. Therefore, in my website she wanted me to include a
        news page, where she can add/delete and update news. Along with this,
        she currently organises the members of her classes (students and teachers
        in each class) using a spreadsheet. This has become a very tedious process
        for her as she has to go through each spreadsheet to add or delete
        members from classes. For this reason, she also asked me to create a classes
        page, where she can select students and add them to a class. Lastly, many
        people interested in joining the dance school are often hesitant as they
        do not know what the dance class entails. This is why Usha instructed me
        to include relevant historical information about the dance form, some
        initial info about classes and information about the head teacher.

            <h2>Sprint One</h2>
            <h4>Aim</h4>
            <p>to create a functioning homepage. I need to decide on the styles and layout which I want.
            On this page my client asked me to include information about the head teacher (Usha) and
            historical information about the dance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Board</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/Sprint1.png">
            <br>
            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <p>When I first began making my homepage, I chose the colour purple as this is my
            client (Usha's) favourite colour, however, when I showed this page to Usha she didn't
            like the colour I chose as it doesn't have much cultural significance. Red is considered
            an auspicious colour in India, and gold is incorporated in many textiles and in jewelry.
            Therefore, I decided for my banner to have gold and maroon in it, and the website to incorporate
            maroon and beige. In addition to this, Usha gave feedback that some of the historical information
            on this page was incorrect. I made sure to do more thorough research and correct my errors. </p>
            <h4>Reflect</h4>
            <p>As you can see from my low-fidelity plans, I really wanted my homepage to include "image buttons".
                Initially, I chose for these images to be square/rectangular, but later decided that round images
                would look more aesthetic. I found it extremely hard to code this, as I had square images and
                didn't know how to make them round. I also didn't know how "combine" the button and the image.
                After some research, I found out that I need to put the code for the image INSIDE the button 'a'
                tag. To make the image round I had to use the bootstrap 'rounded-circle' class. To make the button
                round I made a class btn-round and used 'border-radius'. I was able to make my images round and
                my buttons round, however, there are some design flaws, as the button is triggered when we hover
                near the image (as well as when we hover on the image). I fixed this by In this sprint, I trialed various styles
                (such as the purple background colour, which I changed to beige). Once I finally chose the main
                colour scheme for my website I was able to add CSS ':root' for these and make minor changes in the
                shade of these colours. Creating set colours in the :root area is extremely helpful as we don't
                have to tediously write the red, blue, green ratios for each element in the stylesheet. Instead,
                we can write 'var(--beige)' etc. In this sprint I also explored flask for the first time by setting
                up a layout page. Flask allows me to repeat the basic layout/structure from the 'layout' page on
                all my other page, therefore I was able to create the basic structure for all my pages in the first
                sprint, this includes the navigation bar, banner and footer. The layout page is linked to the stylesheet,
                therefore I was able to style the navigation bar etc. Lastly, you can see that the circular image
                buttons contain digital illustrations of dancers. This is because I struggles to find images for these
                buttons; therefore I had to create illustrations.

<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
<h4>Aim</h4>
<p>
    In this sprint my aim was to create the information page which has all the important information about the
    dance class.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Board</h4>
<img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/Sprint2.png">
<br>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>In this sprint, my client later got the idea for me to include a gallery with Hastak (hand gestures).
Initially, I put the names and meanings of the hastak in a collapse button below. But I got feedback from
one of my stakeholders (Isha) that this makes the page overwhelming as it is hard to know which name/meaning is
associated with which Hastak. Isha is dyslexic, therefore, I made sure to implement her feedback so that the
website is easily accessible by her. This influenced me to include the name and meaning of each hastak as captions.
After this, I got feedback from Usha that some of the names and meaning I included for my Hastak were
incorrect, therefore, I did more research and corrected this. In addition to this, Usha wanted the gallery
to stand-out, therefore I chose to put a maroon background behind the gallery, which contrasts the usual
beige background. Along with this, part way through the project Usha wanted to include a glossary in this
wesbite. I put this glossary in the info page (as a collapse button), but I got feedback from Isha, that
this makes the page too overwhelming. Therefore, I decided to create a separate glossary page.</p>
<h4>Reflect</h4>
<p>
    On this page I struggled to find content. When I first created this page, I only had information about the equipment needed
    and the curriculum of junior and senior classes. This obviously wasn't enough information about the classes and made the
    page feel very 'empty'. After doing extra research about the dance class, I was able to include information about the timings
    for classes and the price for junior and senior students. Initially, I found coding the carousel quite hard, as I had many images
    and I needed to make sure each image had a arrow button to take it to the next image. When I first made this gallery, it didn't work
    as I made a mistake with the button area (below), and put the same number for the data-bs-slide-to area. Once I fixed this the carousel
    worked fine and I even incorporated a carousel in curriculum area (where I show two groups of students). As a dance student myself, my
    client wanted me to include videos of basic dance moves, however, due to time constraints I couldn't complete this. This meant I didn't
    fully complete the end-user requirements. In the future, I would improve my organisation skills and dedicate more time to creating videos.
    As you saw from above, I also made many changes in response to feedback.

<h3>Banner reflection</h3>
<p>Part-way through the project my client told me she didn't like the banners as they were repetitive and boring. This inspired me to incorporate the
illustrations I made of people dancing in my banner. Therefore, you can see below the original banner and the banner after I incorporated illustrations.
Once I made these banners, the trickiest part was overlaying the text. For these new banners I couldn't overlay the text in the middle, as these banners
were asymmetrical and the illustration would have been covered by the text. Therefore, I had to create a new banner element in my layout called 'small banner',
which had a 'small-header' and a 'small-header-quote'. These headers had separate styling from the main banner heading, therefore, I was able to translate the
text so that it aligns to the right. In the first page, I included a Hindi quote on my banner, on the other pages I decided to use the quote area as a subheading,
where I tell describe what this page is for. </p>
<br>
<h4>Here you can see a comparison between the initial banner for pages and final banner. The homepage banner remianed the same throughout, once minor change
was adding a quote next to the header on the banner. The signup, login, add news and registration page banners remained the same. The only difference is that
they are slightly smaller.</h4>

    <h1>Starting Design</h1>
    <p>This is the initial design for my database, I have added the tables as I have added items to my database.
        initially there was only the member and news table, but my database has gradually grown. Only authorised
        users, which are teachers, can add, delete or update news, as well as add and delete people from classes.
        The news page is a very important way for teachers to update their students about upcoming events and
        remind them about homework etc. Even the classes page, is extremely important as it allows teachers
        to organise which students and teachers should be in which class.

    <p>My first 'part' of the database section are 2 linked tables: the news and members table.
        These tables need to be linked through a foreign key so that I can
        link certain members with the news they post. In this sprint I will
        then build the news page by connecting it to the database and outputting
        the news items onto the page. Lastly, I will code so that authorised users
        can create, update and delete news using a form. Throughout this process,
        I will test and run. Below we can see the data plans, tests, project backlog

            is in the 'GET' method). We delete the news using a 'delete' query.</p>

                assign this id we are able to carry out this action (as an id is required to do so).

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
    Loading the tables into the database initially took a while, but this is probably
    because my laptop is slow. After I refreshed the database, everything ran smoothly.
    It is very useful to have all the tables and data values on one file, where we can
    easily change the values, columns or data descriptions. Having a test file is also
    useful, so that we can test the code before putting it into the flask server file.
    The initial stages of this sprint encountered hardly any errors. The create, update
    and delete section also ran fairly smoothly, my query all worked fine when I tested
    them and when I ran the system. Later on in my development process, I also added a
    flash error, which tell the user if they tried to add news which already exists.
    Because of SQL databases built-in validaton (from unique constraints), users can't
    add news which already exists, however, my flash error tell them this. In my video
    test, this flash error was not there as I filmed the test before I implemented this.
    We can see an image of the flash error below.
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/NewsFlashError.png">
    <br>
    <p>
        In this sprint, I did encounter a few errors
    which were mainly caused by 'silly' mistakes I made. For example initially, the
    delete task wasn't working, but this was because I accidentally set the id as 0 (which
    is meant to be for adding), rather than connecting it to the ID of the news item. We can
    see this error in the test below, where I printed the task and id.
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/NewsPrintId&Task.png">
    <br>
    <p>
        I also had an issue where, if I changed the title of my news, the subtitle
        would be altered as well. This was because, I had title in place of subtitle in
        the values tuple. I then had an issue where my news was printing twice onto
        the news page, but this was mainly an html loop issue relating to the HTML news
        page loop. Another issue was: when news was posted or updated, it would have the
        wrong time (e.g have AM instead of PM, vice versa). To fix this, I just needed to
        add a modifier 'localtime' in the datetime brackets. Overall, all these issues were
        fixed. The issue I still haven't been able to fix is the line breaks in the news CUD
        form. Currently, even if there are line breaks (using || char 10 || ) in the database,
        it doesn't show up when outputted onto the news page. Similarly, if the user tries to
        do a line break when adding or updating news, this doesn't show up when the news is pritned on the page.

    <h1>DB sprint 4</h1>
    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>To create a new section of the database: classes. Firstly, I will create a classes table, which
    will contain the title, subtitle and description of our 3 classes. I will create a HTML classes page,
    which is linked to the database and classes data will be outputted onto the page. Then I will create
    an association table, registration, which links the member and classes tables through the member_id
    and class_id. This association table will allow me to insert students into each class. Following this,
    I will create a registration HTML page, which will output the members of each class. Lastly, authorised
    users will be able to add and delete members from each class. Member are added using a small form on the
    registration page. Below we can see a picture of the project backlog and various tests.

    <h3>New layout of news page</h3>

            <p>In photos below we can see a query I did in my test file, where I joined the member and classes
                tables via the registration table using the member_id and class_id. Then I printed the name
                of the members in the registration table and the name of the class they are in.

                the firstname and age group of the member on the select option, therefore I used a select
                query to select these columns from the member table. The idea is that these values would
                be outputted into the select options in the form, which asks you to select members

    <h3>Since these 2 queries were successful, I began implementing this into my server and adding more
        complex parts to this design, such as queries to add or delete members. When an authorised user
        clicks on the 'register' button, they arrive at the register page and a 'GET' method is used
        to request the data needed for this page (which is requested / selected through queries).
    </h3>
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
                In this first photo, we can see the test query has been implemented into the 'GET' method
                of the code, this is so that we can request data from the classes, members and registration tables.
                As mentioned before, this test query links the classes and member table through the association
                table, registration (suing the member_id and class_id). This query is used to output the members
                in each class onto that classes' page. Within photo, we can also see the select query used to select
                all the members. This is done so that these values can be outputted in the select button to add members.
                We can see that the member_list below this query contains the run_search_query_tuples result.

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
                In this part, these are the queries for deleting and adding members. In order to delete a member
                it requires a task, therefore if the task 'delete' is present, then a delete query is used to delete
                this member. This is done by deleting the member from the registration table, where the member_id matches
                the member_id of the person we are removing, and the class_id matches the class_id of the class we are
                deleting from.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The 'Add Member' form on the registration page used the method="POST", therefore, no task is needed to
                add a member, instead we just need to request method="POST". Then we use an 'insert into' query to insert
                the member into the class. We do this by inserting the member_id (of the member selected) and the class_id
                (of the class they are registering in) into the registration page.

    <br>
    <h3>Video Test</h3>
    <p>Lastly, in the video below we can see a full run test of the classes section. It is important to notice
        the small orange tabs, which show-up in the bottom-left corner when certain buttons are hovered over (e.g
        delete). These show the task or ID's for certain buttons (e.g delete button). In this video, it's also
        important to notice that, due to the unique constraints in the database, you cannot add 1 person to a
        class more than once. I added a FLASH error, which pops up and tell the user if the member is already
        in the class. This is extremely important validation as it means we avoid double ups. It would have
        been nice if a notification popped up when a member is added to the class. This would have enhanced
        the visibility of system status and overall usability of my site, this would be something I would
        improve in the future.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Overall, now that I have practice after the news section, I didn't encounter many issues when creating
                the tables and inserting values into them. There was a moment when my unique constraint wasn't working,
                but this was an error from my part where I accidentally inserted "Abhi Banaras Gharana" twice into the
                registration table. It took a long time to figure out how to execute my ideas, as I had many components
                to this database which I wanted to execute. For example, writing a query to join tables was initially
                challenging, but I quickly understood how it works. Outputting the data and deleting members became
                fairly intuitive as I used similar techniques in the News page, however, the most difficult part was
                definitely the 'add member' option. Below we can see an unsuccessful test for adding members. This had
                countless issues. From this test, I understood that I don't need a task for adding members, as I am
                directly posting this from a form which uses the 'POST' method. Nothing else in the classes section
                uses the 'POST' method, therefore I realised I can just use the post method when adding members to
                the registration table. I also realised that I need the 'GET' method to request the member data
                using a select query, I do not need it to insert values into the registration table, that comes after
                posting. Therefore, this initial add_member test actually helped me structure the final registration
                function which I use now, as I realised how to structure my ideas.

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Lastly, another issue I encountered was with outputting the members into the select options. Initially,
                my query only selected members IN the specific class rather than ALL the members. This is because I was
                selecting members in the registration from specific classes. This meant members already in the
                class were showing up in the select options. We can see an example of the issue below:
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Only showing members in class as options</h4>
            <p>I soon realised that I need to select all members from the MEMBER table. This allowed me to fix my query</p>

    <h1>Sprint 5</h1>
    <p>In this sprint I am linking the member table to the signup form. Before, the signup form was just
    'static', meaning that none of the form data was collected or passed to the database. Now, using an
    'insert into' query, I am inserting the data into the member table. After this I will begin working
    on the login page, in which will ask for the email and password. Using a search query, I will select
    the details for the member table where the email = to the email entered in the form. This is an
    important search query as it checks whether this email is in the member table and therefore, if
    this person has signed up. Lastly, if the password in the database matched the password entered
    in the form, we start a session. Lastly, I will create a function which allows user to logout by
    clearing the session. Below we can see the data plan and project backlog. In this sprint, my reflection
    is integrated throughout my examples, as I reference what went well (my successful tests) and issues
    which occured</p>

    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>Initially, when I was beginning to code my signup page, I coded it completely wrong, using the wrong method
    and the wrong type of query. As we can see below, I have my query in the 'GET' method, in reality, it should
    be in the 'POST' method and then I should have an 'insert into' query to insert the form data into the member
    table once the form has been submitted/posted. I initally wrote this in my test file and I thought it was
    'correct' because I forgot I was supposed to insert values into the member table instead.</p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/SignupIncorrectTest.png">
    <br>
    <p>Once I realised that I should be inserting values INTO the member table and not selecting them from the member
        table, I began coding the correct query in my server. I should have originally coded this in my test file
        rather than straight away coding this in my server. If I were to repeat this process, I would make sure to
        get a successful test before adding it to my server.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Before I show you my final code. I found it very hard to work out how to insert the correct authorisation
        into the member table, based on whether they are a student or a teacher. As you may know, in my signup form
        you must select whether you are a teacher, senior student or junior student, you can only select 1 option.
        Teachers are supposed to have an authorisation of 0, and students are supposed to have an authorisation of 1
        whether they are a senior or junior student. Below are some examples of unsuccessful ways I tried to insert
        the correct authorisation into the member table.</p>

            <p>In this first photo below, I was initially trying to start a session as soon as the person signs up.
            However, in this test, I tried to set the authorisation in the session to a particular number
            before I inserted the form data and authorisation into the member page. This didn't work as the system didn't
            recognise 'age_group' and the authorisation number I set was not being inserted into the table. Overall, this
            if/else statement didn't work.

            <br>
            <p>In this next test, I got very close to my final code, I realised that the best way to do this is to have
            a separate 'insert into' query based on whether you are a teacher or student. However, there were still many
            issues with this code. Firstly, my if/else statement wasn't working because the system didn't recognise f['age_group'].

            <h4>age_group issue</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/SignupAuthorisationTrial2Error.png">
            <p>In my final version I changed this to f['selgrouplist'], this worked as the name of my select group options
                is 'selgrouplist'. However, after this I still had an error, except this time it was because 'teacher' wasn't
                recognised. In my form the select option for 'Teacher' has a capital letter at the start, in my code I wrote
                'teacher' without a capital at the start. This meant that the system wasn't recognising the teacher option in
                my form and inserting an authorisation of 1 for both students and teachers. I fixed this issue by making the
                teacher option in my form and database not have a captial letter. This doesn't need further validation because the capital letter in the
                select option can't be changed by the user. Along with this, you can only select 1 option, therefore users
                can't enter any other age group or multiple age groups. Therefore, this should work no matter what.
                Lastly, you can see in both of these tests, I tried to declare a session in the signup page, however,
                I realised that it is probably better to redirect the user to the login page, where they can login and
                a session can be started.

    <h4>Lastly, an issue I only realised recently is that the data which I originally inserted into my
        member table had consistency issues. I realised that the data I inserted only had 'student' written,
        and didn't specify whether they are senior or junior students. Whereas, the users who signup to Kala
        dance have either senior or junior student in the age_group column. This wasn't causing an issues,
        but to keep my data consistent I decided to change this. It is very easy to change as all my data is
        located in one file, which is very convenient

            <h4>Final version server file</h4>
            <p>Below you can see a screenshot of the final code for my signup page. With the 'GET' method, we 'retrieve'
            the signup page. In the 'POST' method, we request the data from the form and begin inserting it into the
            member table. In my form, I have an option where you can select whether you are a teacher, senior student or
            junior student. As you saw above, it was very hard to find a way to insert the correct authorisation into the
            table, but I eventually worked this out using an if else statement. If the select option is 'Teacher', we insert
            all the form data into the table and an authorisation of 0. Else (if they are a senior or junior student), we
            insert all the form data with an authorisation of 1. We can see at the bottom of this code, if the result is false we show an error. I used a
            new convention here, 'flash', which flashes the error at the top of the page and the user can press the 'X'
            button to get rid of the notification. If the user successfully signs up, they are redirected to the login
            page to login. </p>

    <h3>Login Section of Sprint 5</h3>
    <p>Before I started working on the session part of my login, I first tested my select query test if it
    selected values from the member table WHERE the email is equal to the email which I put in the return
    render template. This is an email which is already in the member table. This test was successful, but
    instead of testing this in my test file, I straight-away started coding in my server file. Throughout the
    login I took tests while coding in my server file, however, in the future it would be better to code this
    in my test file before implementing it into my server</p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/LoginSelectingValuesTestSuccess.png">
    <br>
    <p>For the login section, I created a smaller form, which only asks for the email address and password of
    the user. We can see from the server file below that I am using a select query, which selects the values from
    the member table where the email is equal to the one entered in the form. This query is a good way to check if
    user is in the member table, therefore it checks if they have an account. Then we can see that IF we receive a
    and IF the password of our result is equal to the password in the login from, we begin a session. The session
    is a very crucial part of the website, as it means the person can remain logged in. In this session, we set
    values based on the values we selected from the database using our select query. After this we redirect for the
    index/homepage, if this "if" statement doesn't work, then an error message "credentials not recognised" prints
    and the session in NOT started. We can also see that I printed the authorisation values to test whether my session
    code worked.
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/FinalLoginCode.png">
    <br>
    <p>We can see that when the form was filled in, the session was successfully printing in the server run</p>

    <h3>Logout Section for Sprint 5</h3>
    <p>Lastly, I created a very simple app.route / function to logout the user, all we need to do is clear the
    session. The next step I took was validating the homepage, news page and classes page. In the pictures below, you can see the code which
    validates each page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Validation for Login & Signup button</h3>
    <p>On the homepage I added validation which meant, if a session has been started (user is logged in), the
        'signup' and 'login' button is replaced with a logout button which is linked to the logout app.route.
        A member_id session is also required, this is because the Flash notification 'creates its own session',
        but without a member id. Without requiring the member_id, it causes the logout button to show up even if
        the user isn't signed in. Therefore, we require the member id.
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/LoginSignupBtnCode.png">
    <br>
    <h3>Validation for News Page</h3>
    <p>On the news page, I added validation so that, if you are logged in (session started) and if you are a teacher
        (authorisation 0) then you can add or delete news
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="assets/images/NewsValidation.png">
    <br>
    <h3>Validation for Classes page</h3>
    <p>I then added validation which meant that, if you are logged in and if you are a teacher, you can access
        the registration page. Accessing this page means you can see the members and add or delete members of
        from each class.

    <h1>Sprint 6</h1>
    <p>This was a very small sprint where I created a glossary by creating a glossary table in my database, and outputting its values
        onto my glossary page (in a table). I didn't face many errors in this sprint.

    <br>
    <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
    <p>
   In conclusion, I have included various tests and evidence which show how my program has gradually
    developed. Even though it was challenging at times, I managed to fix all the issues which occurred in
    my sprints and did a final video test run to show the functionality of program at the end of each
    sprint. In this database, I created a glossary table which is outputted onto a glossary page,
    this data doesn't need to be connected to any other table. Some improvements that could have been made to the
    website would be: allowing users to confirm/edit/delete their details once signing up, allow members to add
    words to the glossary and more images. I was following Agile proccesses, which includes planning, testing and
    reviewing each sprint, however, I don't think I did enough planning. I only made low-fidelity plans and banner sketches in the initial
    stages of developing my website. This meant that if my client didn't like any changes I made, I didn't have any
    fresh plans to base my new design off. This resulted in me spending many hours trialling various styles. In the future,
    I would try to plan each sprint with pseudo code and low fidelity sketches. This way, I would waste time trialling styles
    and code. One future aspiration is to connect every Hindi/Sanskrit word in the website to the glossary page so that people
    can click on the word and it takes them to the glossary page (similar to Wikipedia). Another future aspiration
    for my glossary page is to include videos or animations on how to pronounce certain words (as Hindi/Sanskrit
    words are hard to pronounce). However, these elements weren't priorities therefore was unable to do them due to time constraints.
    <br>
    In terms of my digital outcome, it is functional and the front-end is aesthetically pleasing. However, throughout
    my reflections I highlighted certain aspects which could be improved or aspects which were challenging. Firsty (as mentioned many times),
    I found it very hard to find images for my website. This is mainly because I wanted my website to include South Asian Students wearing
    traditional clothing (because it suits the aesthetics of my website). However, it was very hard to get these images as most dance students
    show up to class in casual/western clothing (and Indian clothing takes a while to put on). For this reason, I did not have enough images.
    This meant I had to resort to creating digital illustrations and implementing these throughout my website. In the
    future, I would spend more time trying to organise 'photoshoots' with dance students. Along with this,
    I couldn't include dance videos (requested by my client) due to time constraints, which means I didn't fully meet the end-user requirements. In the
    future I would improve my organisational skills and dedicate more time towards this. One feature of my outcome, which was challenging was overlaying text
    over the banners. This was challenging because, for my homepage banner, the text needed to be overlayed in the center. For the other pages, the text
    needed to be aligned to the right. This meant that (in my layout page) I needed to have a separate banner area for the other banners. I'm not sure if
    this was exactly the right approach as it was a little repetitive, however, it was functional.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Describing and Addressing Relevant Implications for Database and Digital Outcome:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Privacy:</b></li>
        <p>Decribe: To ensure we are following the relevant implication of privacy,
            we must ensure we have kept personal data safe. We should make sure that only
            authorised users should be able to access certain personal data. The data shouldn’t be
            easily and directly accessible by the user, we can test this by seeing if http://127.0.0.1:8000/data
            takes us to the data folder. In addition to this, it is standard for passwords to be ‘hashed’,
            meaning that the password is converted into a series of letters and numbers using an encryption algorithm.
            Lastly, we shouldn’t collect unnecessary data from the user.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: While constructing our database and integrating it into the website, I didn’t address privacy as
            much as a professional web developer would. For example, I do not have an encryption algorithm to hash
            password, in the future, I would include this to further increase the privacy of my database. However,
            we had some forms of data protection. For example, the data was not directly accessible via the
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/data link, and instead, an error page was given. I don’t collect too much
            personal information from the user, other than their name, I ask for their email and whether
            they are a student or teacher. Asking whether they are a student or teacher is purely to increase
            the privacy of this database by making teachers authorised users. In my database, on the registration
            pages for each class, the students and teachers in the class are displayed. In order to view the
            class members, you must be an authorised member, which is a teacher. This is good because it means
            that not all users can view who is in each class. However, one issue is that anyone can sign-up and
            become a teacher. If this was a real dance class, I would put extra measures in place that require the
            teacher to provide some form of identification that they are a dance teacher from this school.  </p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>Intellectual Property:</b></li>
        <p>Describe: Intellectual Property relates to 'who owns material'. When a website is created, all images in
        the website should be owned by the developer (not stolen from the internet). In addition to this, the website
        should have a protected IP, and all the images on this website should be protected.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: In all honesty, I didn't protect my IP address and the images on my website very much. I was
            able to get my website live, but I wasn't very sure how to 'secure' this website to make sure it's
            not easily stolen. In addition to this, my github repository for this page is public, therefore, anyone
            could perhaps view my code and copy it; as I do not have any legal documents to protect my material. In
            terms of images, I made sure all images were owned by me, or I took the permission of the person I was
            taking the image from. When I didn't have enough images, instead of taking them from the internet, I made
            digital illustration. This was to ensure all the intellectual property was owned by me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>Functionality:</b></li>
        <p>Describe: For a database to be functional, there shouldn’t be any glitches, all queries should
            work correctly and all the buttons to carry out those queries should also work. The database
            should have also been tested regularly while we were coding. There shouldn’t be any errors
            when carrying out queries and the data in each column should be consistent. Foreign Keys must
            also be associated correctly. E.g the correct member must be associated with the class their
            in, or with the news they’ve posted. We must address Functionality through accurate entity
            relationship diagrams, creating an SQL installer file so that it's easy to make small changes
            and corrections in the database and extensive testing of the database queries and how they
            are outputted onto our web pages.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: Throughout this process, I tested my database consistently and comprehensively. I ran many
            tests for my queries in the testing file and within my server. I also viewed my tables to check that
            the data is consistent, e.g. the date being in the SQLite data format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00". When
            checking the consistency of my data, I noticed one issue: the students I inserted into the database
            only had the word ‘student’ in their age group. Whereas, those who signed up through the form had
            ‘senior student’ or ‘junior student’ in their age group. Because all my data is in my SQL installer
            file, I easily fixed this inconsistency, by changing all the students in the member table to either
            ‘senior student’ or ‘junior student’; without facing any other problems. This SQL installer file has
            given me the confidence to alter my data and rebuild my database throughout this process, allowing
            me to refine my database design. Pieces of data such as my member name or member email only appear
            once in my database. Most importantly, I have made member emails unique because these are necessary
            to distinguish between members in the table. Two members could have the same name despite being two
            different people (e.g John Bradon), having the email unique means we can still distinguish between
            them. I have also made as many data fields as I can unique and not null, this means that the database
            is ‘self-validated’, as it is able to spot when a unique constraint is failed (e.g repeated entries),
            or missed fields. If I require items from my member table in other parts of the database (e.g a member
            name posted with a news item), I link them through foreign keys. Lastly, Bootstrap has built-in validation,
            such as not allowing empty fields in forms. Bootstrap also allows the developer to write the specific type
            of data being requested in form questions (e.g email), therefore, if the user enters an email address which
            doesn't follow the typical format for emails, bootstrap will ot allow the user to submit the form until a
            valid email is entered.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>Accessibility/Usability</b></li>
        <p>Describe: For a website to be usable it should show when an error
        has occurred (visibility of system status) and allow users to correct it
        and it should use recognised conventions (match between system and real world).
        An Accessible website should cater to everyone's needs, e.g dyslexic, colourblind
        people. The website should also be viewable on different devices or with different screen
        sizes. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: Throughout my program, I have included error messages, such as: for news I have an error page
        which reads "do not know what to do with create, read, update on news (key not present)", similarly with
        the login, an error message is printed if credentials are not recognised. For the signup page,
        I also printed a flash error which tell the user if they already have an account. For the classes page,
        I included a flash error which tells the user if a student is already in the class. Lastly, for the news page
        I included a flash error, which tell the user if the news they are adding already exists. When the error is presented,
        the user has been redirected to the page where they need to correct the error. For example, on the signup page, if
        the user already has an account it redirects them to the login page and shows the FLASH error message "looks like you already
        have an account". The usability of this site would have been improved if I added a confirmation message when a student is
        added to a class (for visibility of system status). One thing which I was not able to include was an option for the user
        to edit their details once they sign up. In my current design, the user fills the form and once they submit the form,
        their details are inserted into the member table straight away. They are not given the option to confirm, edit or delete
        their account; they can only logout. In the future, I would definitely implement this in my design, as currently, the user
        is 'trapped' in the Kala dance online community once they sign up.

        In terms of functionality I used contrasting colours and tested this with various colour blind filters.
         In general and with various filters, the Hindi text on my banner is slightly hard to read, as it is small
         & clashes with some of the gold colours in the banner. However, this text is mainly decorative as most of
         my user's can't read Hindi. Desppite this, in the future I would perhaps make the Hindi text bigger or use
         a brighter beige colour to make it more visible. One positive is that the English translation for this quote
         is extremely visible as the text is maroon and the background is beige.
         Another way in which I considered accessibility is by considering my dyslexic user. I made sure to regulary
         review my sprints with her to make sure that the layout of my pages wasn't too overwhelming. I also did research
         and used Open Sans font on my website, as it's a readible font for those with dyslexia; because it doesn't have any 'fancy curves',
         the letters are well spaced out and bold. I also made sure NOT to use italics, as this can make it hard for
         dyslexic students to read. Lastly, I considered the my website on different screen sizes. I made sure to use
         @media queries to adjust elements in my code based on different screen sizes. This was helpful, as I made sure
         that everything in my website resized until the smallest screen size. But I still faced some issues, as when
         the page size reduced, the banner in all my pages often becomes much smaller than the images on the page (even
         carousel images), therefore this makes the page look un-proportional. When I tested my website on my phone,
         there we also a few pages in which the text was 'overflowing' from the banners. On some of the other pages,
         the banner was cut-off slightly. In addition to this, the banner was very small compared to images in the
        website (similar to small screen size on laptop). Other than this, the website was functional on the mobile
         phone and all the text was readable. In the future, I would consider a 'mobile first' technique, where you
         test the website on a mobile phone before testing it on a laptop.

        <li><b>Sustainability and Future Proofing:</b></li>
        <p>Describe: Sustainability and Future-proofing means the database should be able to be updated and
            extended, and we should be able to add new features. The database should be coded in such a way
            that it can be handed over to another developer who can understand it easily, and develop it
            further. We should have different tables for different entities. In addition to this, we should
            be able to add more data to existing tables, change values, change data descriptions and link
            in new tables without needing to change any pre-existing tables. We can do this by using foreign
            keys, which means that any updates to the data, such as the member name, only need to be changed
            in the member table once. It is then changed in all the linked tables (through the foreign key),
            and the values would automatically update if it’s used in any queries.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: In my database, I had a different table for members, news, classes and registration. This
            allowed me to link various tables together through foreign keys, for example, the member and news
            tables were linked through a foreign key and the member and classes table were linked through an
            association table, registration. This also meant that any changes I made to the data values in my
            table, were automatically changed in the other tables. We saw an example of this when I changed
            ‘student’ in my member table to ‘junior student’ or ‘senior student’. Due to the SQL installer
            file, it also makes it easy for anyone in the future to make changes to elements in the database
            as all the data-tables are in one area and are connected. This means new variables, new tables and
            new values can easily be added to the database. This website allows for change, as authorised users
            can add/update/delete news and add/delete class members. This means that the website is sustainable
            and future-proofed for users. One area which could have been improved was the glossary. Although
            changes can be made to the glossary table in the SQL file, changes cannot be made by the user. The
            glossary page is presented as a static page (despite the values being in the database). This means
            if the website is updated and new Hindi/Sanskrit words are added on other pages, the user can't add
            these words to the glossary. In the future, I would allow authorised users to add new words through
            a form on the website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>Aesthetics:</b></li>
        <p>Describe: For a website to be aesthetic, it must have minimalistic design features (e.g minimal colour pallet) and
            a match between the system and real world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: In my website, I kept my colour scheme to a minimum of maroon, beige and a little bit of red. This ensured
            that my website wasn't too overwhelming to look at and was cohesive. I also used conventions that match between the
            'real world'/modern websites. For example, my navigation was at the top of the page, with the login/signup/logout
            button in the top right corner. The 'match between system and real world' makes the website easy to navigate and
            not overwhelming for the user (as this is a convention commonly used in other websites). I also included some of my
            own design features, for example on my website 'interactve features' (e.g forms, news items, classes, class members)
            have round containers, whereas I chose for 'static' pages to have non-rounded containers. This made it easier to
            distinguish between interactive pages and non-interactive pages. Lastly, (because I didn't have enough images),
            I made digital illustration. These illustration were aesthetic as they were minimalistic (not much detail such
            shading), and they followed my maroon and beige colour scheme. One downside was that they were used quite frequently
            in my website (in the banners, in the circular image-buttons, and in the class page). Because of this, it may cause
            my website to be less visually interesting. In the future I would dedicate more time for finding images, as this
            would ensure variety in my website.

        </p>
        <br>
        <li><b>End-user considerations:</b></li>
        <p>Describe: This means that the data needs to be queried and outputted in a way that caters to the
            user's needs; for example, we could make sure that it appeals to the right demographic. It should
            be presented so that it ‘matches the real world’ in terms of the user’s expectations for a modern
            website. We can do this by presenting data in a clear organised structure. Along with this, forms
            should allow the users to add entries and update or delete existing entries in the database. For
            the digital outcome, it should include features that follow the client's requirements and that
            consider the main stakeholders/end-users.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Address: In my database design, end-user considerations are evident in the news, classes and registration page.
            On my website, all the data information is outputted in a tidy manner; such as each individual news item, classes
            and class members being 'wrapped' in their own container. Users are able to update news and classes in a way
            that aligns with the ‘the real world’ and modern websites as they use simple forms. This makes it easy for
            users to understand what to do on each page.  On my news page, as soon as the change has been made (in the news_cud
            form), it redirects to the news page, where we can see immediate confirmation that our action has occurred. The
            same applies for registration, where the user can immediately see if they have added or deleted a user, as both these actions
            occur on the registration page. However, one way I could improve the registration page in the future is by
            giving the user conformation of a student being added to a class. For my signup and login form, the user
            receives an error message that clearly communicates the reason why the action has failed, e.g. credentials
            not recognised for the login page, and 'looks like you already have an account' for the signup page. For my
            classes page, I do have an Flash error for when the user tries to add a member who is
            already in the class. </p>
        <br>
        <p>One way I address end-user considerations is by considering my stakeholders. By following UX design principles,
            I was able to identify my stakeholder and identify their needs. My stakeholders are Indian
            dance students (who are the most common members of this dance class). Throughout my website and
            my data (such as news, classes, etc.), I have been considerate of Indian culture, by using the correct
            words used in Kathak dance, such as Gharana, Tukda, Tatkaar, etc. I made sure not to use English translation
            of theres words in my website, as I didn't want Indian students to feel that their culture/language has been
            adapted to cater to a non-Indian audience. I have also considered the non-Indian population or those who don't
            understand Hindi terms and dance terms by implementing a glossary. This glossary is in my database and allows
            those who don't understand certain terms to learn the meaning and pronunciation. Along with this, I chose to
            only use images of South-Asian dancers. This is because, although Usha's class is diverse, I wanted South Asian
            students to feel represented within their own culture. One way I didn't fully meet end-user requirements is by
            not including dance videos which were requested by my client. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to create
            videos of basic Kathak dance steps, which meant I didn't meet this requirement.
        </p>

    </ul>

<h2>Finalising and Testing</h2>
    <p>After all these test, I tried to minimize my errors a much as possble, such as reducing the length of ALT tags.
    I also fixed structural issues (e.g h1 header followed by h3 header), by chaning the order of headers. Lastly, there
    were some errors (e.g contrast errors), which I couldn't change as i would need to change my colour scheme for that.
    However, the contrast test shows that, to make my website more accessable, I could have use more contrasting colours.
    The empty button error seemed to be related to the hamburger symbol, therefore this was a error I couldn't fix</p>
